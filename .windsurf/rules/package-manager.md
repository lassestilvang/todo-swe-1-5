This rule enforces the use of Bun as the package manager for this project. All package management operations should be performed using Bun commands rather than npm or yarn.

**Commands to use:**
- `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `bun add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>` or `yarn add <package>`
- `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn <script>`
- `bun test` instead of `npm test` or `yarn test`

**Why Bun?**
- Faster installation and execution
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Compatible with npm packages
- Smaller memory footprint
- First-class support in this project template

**Note:** This rule is enforced by the project configuration and will be checked automatically during development.
